        <h2>Much Ado About Nothing</h2>
        <h3>SCENE I. A hall in LEONATO'S house.</h3>
        Enter LEONATO, ANTONIO, HERO, BEATRICE, and others
        LEONATO
        Was not Count John here at supper?
        ANTONIO
        I saw him not.
        BEATRICE
        How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see
        him but I am heart-burned an hour after.
        HERO
        He is of a very melancholy disposition.
        BEATRICE
        He were an excellent man that were made just in the
        midway between him and Benedick: the one is too
        like an image and says nothing, and the other too
        like my lady's eldest son, evermore tattling.
        LEONATO
        Then half Signior Benedick's tongue in Count John's
        mouth, and half Count John's melancholy in Signior
        Benedick's face,--
        BEATRICE
        With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money
        enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman
        in the world, if a' could get her good-will.
        LEONATO
        By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a
        husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.
        ANTONIO
        In faith, she's too curst.
