        <h3>SCENE I. A hall in LEONATO'S house.</h3>
        Enter LEONATO, ANTONIO, HERO, BEATRICE, and others
        <h6> LEONATO</h6>

        <p> Was not Count John here at supper?</p>
        <h6> ANTONIO</h6>
        <p>I saw him not.</p>
        <h6> BEATRICE</h6>
        <p>How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see
            him but I am heart-burned an hour after.</p>
        <h6> HERO</h6>
        <p>He is of a very melancholy disposition.</p>
        <h6> BEATRICE</h6>
        <p>He were an excellent man that were made just in the
            midway between him and Benedick: the one is too
            like an image and says nothing, and the other too
            like my lady's eldest son, evermore tattling.</p>
        <h6> LEONATO</h6>
        <p>Then half Signior Benedick's tongue in Count John's
            mouth, and half Count John's melancholy in Signior
            Benedick's face,--</p>
        <h6> BEATRICE</h6>
        <p>With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money
            enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman
            in the world, if a' could get her good-will.</p>
        <h6> LEONATO</h6>
        <p>By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a
            husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.</p>
        <h6>ANTONIO</h6>
        <p>In faith, she's too curst.</p>
