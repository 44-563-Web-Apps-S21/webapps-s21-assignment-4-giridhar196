        <h2> SCENE II. The same.</h2>
        Enter DON JOHN and BORACHIO
        <h6 class="don-john name">DON JOHN</h6>
        <p class="speech">It is so; the Count Claudio shall marry the
            daughter of Leonato.</p>
        <h6 class="borachio name">BORACHIO</h6>
        <p class="speech">Yea, my lord; but I can cross it.</p>
        <h6 class="don-john name">DON JOHN</h6>
        <p class="speech">Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be
            medicinable to me: I am sick in displeasure to him,
            and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges
            evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage?</p>
        <h6 class="borachio name">BORACHIO</h6>
        <p class="speech">Not honestly, my lord; but so covertly that no
            dishonesty shall appear in me.</p>
        <h6 class="don-john name">DON JOHN</h6>
        <p class="speech">Show me briefly how.</p>
        <h6 class="borachio name">BORACHIO</h6>
        <p class="speech">I think I told your lordship a year since, how much
            I am in the favour of Margaret, the waiting
            gentlewoman to Hero.</p>
        <h6 class="don-john name">DON JOHN</h6>
        I remember.
        <h6 class="borachio name">BORACHIO</h6>
        <p class="speech">I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night,
            appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window.</p>
        <p class="speech">Exeunt</p>
